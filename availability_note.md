Availability Note (Jan 12 2026 – Jul 30 2026)
- I am currently awaiting confirmation of my 8th semester college schedule, including whether classes will be conducted online or offline, as well as the exact examination dates. Based on prior academic patterns, sessional assessments are tentatively expected around February and April, with final examinations likely in May; however, exact dates are not yet confirmed.
- I will be completely unavailable from 9 March 2026 to 25 March 2026 due to a pre-planned Umrah pilgrimage during Ramadan. This is a fixed and non-negotiable religious commitment.
- Outside of the above window and potential exam periods, I expect to be consistently available and can commit to the minimum four-month internship duration if selected.
